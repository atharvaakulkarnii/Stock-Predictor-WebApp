# Stock-Predictor
The following project uses RNN called long short term memory (LSTM) for predicting the closing stock price of a corporation using the last past 60 days stock price.

We have used LSTM rather than Bert or Gru because,
LSTM is a RNN Architecture used in the field of deep learning unlike other architecture 
LSTM has feedback connections they can not only process the single data points like images but also an entire sequence of data
